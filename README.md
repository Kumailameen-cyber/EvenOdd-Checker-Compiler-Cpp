# EvenOdd-Checker-Compiler-C-
This C++ program, titled EvenLang Mini Compiler, is a conceptual demonstration of the fundamental phases of a compiler. It processes user input through a structured pipeline—Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis, and Code Generation—to determine whether a given integer is even or odd.
